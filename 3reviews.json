Build 4/5. >>3.Audio Quality: 3.5/5. >>4.Bluetooth Connectivity: 4.5/5 5.Battery: 4/5 >>6.Noise Cancellation: 3/5 >>7.Longevity:2/5  All good. But the BIGGEST ISSUE. Since its so compact, its battery is compact as well. So it started after around 1 year, 8 months after purchase the BATTERY started getting drained badly.  And now exactly after 2 years, it lasts for around 75mins. the battery can not be replaced. So it has a life of 24months max. So if you are willing to pay 13k(i had paid 15k) for a headphone that lasts 2 years, its a GREAT BUY. Seamless connectivity across the Apple ecosystem, and great Bluetooth connectivity.

I am not an audiophile but I have an issue with all headphone and earphones use if it\u2019s more than an hour . AirPods have such good design that I never felt an issue . Sound quality is close to awesome , I mean it is best that one could expect from a open set of earphones . This can be used as a daily driver .  The only issue I observed with AirPods is its battery life post 1.5 years of usage . I have to get a new piece after 18 months as after a single charge they could work at best to 30 minutes which is not at all acceptable .  After spending huge amount one would expect atleast 1 hour of use post one full charge ( only earbuds , not case ). At present Apple doesn\u2019t has a battery or earbud replacement program . The cost of replacing two earbuds is same as buying a new one . Over all it\u2019s a good buy if you are planning to use it for 1-2 year . If you are someone who expects a long life from electronics -2-3 years . This isn\u2019t a right choice ."}, {"rating": ["3.0 out of 5 stars"], "title": "Okay okay \ud83d\udc4c", "body": "Sounds quality good, battery life also good, value of money but after some time \ud83d\udd52 lil bit battery life low but it's okay iPhone ho aur airpods na ho esa ho hi nhi sakta"}]]
