"2.0 out of 5 stars","Issues with battery drainage with Left airpod","Super Fast delivery by Amazon and best sound quality on such an amazing product by Apple. Sound Quality:4.5(dont expect too much Bass as its not an in ear earphones the mid and highs are par decent) Build Quality- 4 (expected design changes from Apple) Connectivity:-5 Best ever if you are in the apple eco-system delivery-5 I had two issues with my Airpod:- 1- First time when i paired my earphones with my phone the left earpiece was not working. This was resolved after resetting the Pod. However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product. 2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%. Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.  - Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart. The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my product POOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.  I am definitely going to buy the product again after i receive my refund back but not from Amazon. Amazon is great but they didnt had any stock left and i don't want to get into this trouble again.  I am sure my post will be overlooked and Amazon will not pay any heed to all the troubles and discomfort i had with this purchase. However i hope this somehow helps you for your next purchase."

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Why I had to return them","Pros Good sound quality, extremely easy to connect to iPhone/Mac, good connectivity range. BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment. They are good to take small 2-3 hrs of calls/music a day, in a office/home, where you know, you can recharge them again before your next usage."

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Why I had to return them","Pros Good sound quality, extremely easy to connect to iPhone/Mac, good connectivity range. BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment.

Sound Quality:4.5(dont expect too much Bass as its not an in ear earphones the mid and highs are par decent) Build Quality- 4 (expected design changes from Apple) Connectivity:-5 Best ever if you are in the apple eco-system delivery-5 I had two issues with my Airpod:- 1- First time when i paired my earphones with my phone the left earpiece was not working. This was resolved after resetting the Pod. However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product. 2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%. Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.  - Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart. The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my product POOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.  I am definitely going to buy the product again after i receive my refund back but not from Amazon. Amazon is great but they didnt had any stock left and i don't want to get into this trouble again.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Why I had to return them","Pros Good sound quality, extremely easy to connect to iPhone/Mac, good connectivity range. BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment. They are good to take small 2-3 hrs of calls/music a day, in a office/home, where you know, you can recharge them again before your next usage."

Sound Quality:4.5(dont expect too much Bass as its not an in ear earphones the mid and highs are par decent) Build Quality- 4 (expected design changes from Apple) Connectivity:-5 Best ever if you are in the apple eco-system delivery-5 I had two issues with my Airpod:- 1- First time when i paired my earphones with my phone the left earpiece was not working. This was resolved after resetting the Pod. However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product. 2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%. Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.  - Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart. The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my product POOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.  I am definitely going to buy the product again after i receive my refund back but not from Amazon. Amazon is great but they didnt had any stock left and i don't want to get into this trouble again.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Why I had to return them","Pros Good sound quality, extremely easy to connect to iPhone/Mac, good connectivity range. BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment.

Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment.

And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment. They are good to take small 2-3 hrs of calls/music a day, in a office/home, where you know, you can recharge them again before your next usage."

This was resolved after resetting the Pod. However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product. 2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%. Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.  - Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart. The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my product POOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Why I had to return them","Pros Good sound quality, extremely easy to connect to iPhone/Mac, good connectivity range. BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment. They are good to take small 2-3 hrs of calls/music a day, in a office/home, where you know, you can recharge them again before your next usage."

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Apple AirPods don’t work","The product does not work from day 3 after just 3 uses. The Apple stores who checked it made an unofficial comment that we have received an used piece but was not ready to give it in writing . They tried to pair it for one more time and then again it stopped working after one try . I do not know who to reach out to for the failure of such an expensive product . Apple says they will not replace it and asks us to reach back and complain to amazon ."

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Going good until the left AirPod stopped working","Everything was good until my left AirPod stopped working intermittently  The left AirPod didn’t work properly for me and luckily it will work sometimes  It’s been just 3 months since I bought it and here comes the issue  However, I have it covered under the warranty, will need to step out and get it fixed"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Issues with battery drainage with Left airpod","Super Fast delivery by Amazon and best sound quality on such an amazing product by Apple. Sound Quality:4.5(dont expect too much Bass as its not an in ear earphones the mid and highs are par decent) Build Quality- 4 (expected design changes from Apple) Connectivity:-5 Best ever if you are in the apple eco-system delivery-5 I had two issues with my Airpod:- 1- First time when i paired my earphones with my phone the left earpiece was not working. This was resolved after resetting the Pod. However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product. 2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%. Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.  - Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart. The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my product POOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.  I am definitely going to buy the product again after i receive my refund back but not from Amazon. Amazon is great but they didnt had any stock left and i don't want to get into this trouble again.  I am sure my post will be overlooked and Amazon will not pay any heed to all the troubles and discomfort i had with this purchase. However i hope this somehow helps you for your next purchase."

"2.0 out of 5 stars","There was a dirt","I am not sure if this is a refurbished, it has some dirt inside but there was no damage.  Did not return it as it was working fine"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Why I had to return them","Pros Good sound quality, extremely easy to connect to iPhone/Mac, good connectivity range. BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment. They are good to take small 2-3 hrs of calls/music a day, in a office/home, where you know, you can recharge them again before your next usage."
