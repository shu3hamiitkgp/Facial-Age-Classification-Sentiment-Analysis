Sound Quality:4.5(dont expect too much Bass as its not an in ear earphones the mid and highs are par decent) Build Quality- 4 (expected design changes from Apple) Connectivity:-5 Best ever if you are in the apple eco-system delivery-5 I had two issues with my Airpod:- 1- First time when i paired my earphones with my phone the left earpiece was not working. This was resolved after resetting the Pod. However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product. 2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%. Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.  - Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart. The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my product POOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.  I am definitely going to buy the product again after i receive my refund back but not from Amazon. Amazon is great but they didnt had any stock left and i don't want to get into this trouble again.  I am sure my post will be overlooked and Amazon will not pay any heed to all the troubles and discomfort i had with this purchase.

BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment.

Sound Quality:4.5(dont expect too much Bass as its not an in ear earphones the mid and highs are par decent) Build Quality- 4 (expected design changes from Apple) Connectivity:-5 Best ever if you are in the apple eco-system delivery-5 I had two issues with my Airpod:- 1- First time when i paired my earphones with my phone the left earpiece was not working. This was resolved after resetting the Pod. However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product. 2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%. Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.  - Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart. The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my product POOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.  I am definitely going to buy the product again after i receive my refund back but not from Amazon. Amazon is great but they didnt had any stock left and i don't want to get into this trouble again.  I am sure my post will be overlooked and Amazon will not pay any heed to all the troubles and discomfort i had with this purchase. However i hope this somehow helps you for your next purchase."}, {"rating": ["2.0 out of 5 stars"], "title": "Call quality not good", "body": "My calls are not coming thru properly .

BUT!  Con1 I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.  Con2 Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.  Con3 When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.  Verdict These are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment. They are good to take small 2-3 hrs of calls/music a day, in a office/home, where you know, you can recharge them again before your next usage."}, {"rating": ["2.0 out of 5 stars"], "title": "Loose contact", "body": "Most of the time, only one earphone charges in the charging case.
