"3.0 out of 5 stars","Good earphones but not stellar","The particular piece received has a slightly loose hinge on the case. I have used the previous generation Airpods for 2 years and there was no issue. I guess the quality levels have fallen. Apple India has refused to accept this as a warranty issue. Sound quality is good and same as Airpods from 1st gen. There is no noise cancelling feature for that you will need to look at the Airpods pro and shell out extra dough It pairs much faster with devices as compared to last generation Airpods and “hey Siri” feature is great. Expect a lifetime of slightly over 2 years as the battery starts to wear out and there is no way to replace the battery in the buds Overall a good earphones but with some flaws"

Great voice quality and highly convenient for long calls. You can do all your chores while talking with friends/family.  Cons:  1. Zero Noise cancellation 2. The case gets in 2-3 days of normal use 3. Not good for workout (running, gymming, training, etc) 4. Obviously, overpriced."

There is Zero noise cancellation. I would like to return this Can I? Its a waste of money"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Too overpriced.","Have used these and OnePlus buds z. OnePlus is by far better in sound quality and isolation."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Genuine but received scratched product .","The media could not be loaded. The product is good, I had some confusion regarding the genuineness of the product, I contacted the Amazon customer service and their behaviour was very harsh. Later on after seeing all the reviews & the images of the product I too noticed a lot of scratches on the case of the product. The product is genuine but somehow I feel like it’s a used one, Amazon should replace the same."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Able to converse hand free","It worked for initial about 7-8 days. It is not working at all now. Due to COVID, I am not visiting any service centre. Please help. Thanks"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Good earphones but not stellar","The particular piece received has a slightly loose hinge on the case. I have used the previous generation Airpods for 2 years and there was no issue. I guess the quality levels have fallen. Apple India has refused to accept this as a warranty issue. Sound quality is good and same as Airpods from 1st gen. There is no noise cancelling feature for that you will need to look at the Airpods pro and shell out extra dough It pairs much faster with devices as compared to last generation Airpods and “hey Siri” feature is great. Expect a lifetime of slightly over 2 years as the battery starts to wear out and there is no way to replace the battery in the buds Overall a good earphones but with some flaws"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Nc is not up to the mark bt sound is very good","Good"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Good product","Good sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity. The only reason i have given 3 stars for the product is that once when the ear phones were not working when i took it to the Apple store, they said the warranty was expired since the product was purchased much earlier in july though the amazon invoice says 2nd December 2019. Beware of that."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","But original ones are great, personally I ordered from here and it was fake","Look airpods itself are amazing without a doubt. But i got a fake one so definitely my experience was bad. I am user of airpods since launch and its very handy. Go for it. Just dont buy it on amazon they cant control delivery people but lot many times cargo comes fake"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Zero Noise Cancellation - Rest is good","Review after using for 1 month:  Pros:  1. The sound quality is amazing if you are sitting in a quite environment. 2. Extremely light weight. 3. Charging case can charge them for 4 times. 4. Fits most of the ears, please go to nearest apple store, try them for 20-25 mins, if you feel comfortable then only buy. 5. Great voice quality and highly convenient for long calls. You can do all your chores while talking with friends/family.  Cons:  1. Zero Noise cancellation 2. The case gets in 2-3 days of normal use 3. Not good for workout (running, gymming, training, etc) 4. Obviously, overpriced."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Worth of buying.","I didn't even expected good sound quality. Sound is good. in my case I got the defect product. both the left and right earpods were not pairing with each other and I was getting continues blinks with amber light. tried with the Amazon customer care, no body responded. Finally I had to return this product and now I have purchased from the store directly and using nicely now."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Cap is making sound while pressing from top ends","The media could not be loaded.

I went to apple as i thought it was under warranty but again it’s apple. They told me that the mesh of the airpod was damaged.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Two Years LIFE for 15k?","Its a LONG TERM review!! So read till the END. It will LAST FOR TWO YEARS. It was bought by me in Aug 2018. Yes, 2 years back. It was my third apple product, after iPhone 7, and watch series 3. About the product: 1.Design: 3.5/5. >>2. Build 4/5. >>3.Audio Quality: 3.5/5. >>4.Bluetooth Connectivity: 4.5/5 5.Battery: 4/5 >>6.Noise Cancellation: 3/5 >>7.Longevity:2/5  All good. But the BIGGEST ISSUE. Since its so compact, its battery is compact as well. So it started after around 1 year, 8 months after purchase the BATTERY started getting drained badly.  And now exactly after 2 years, it lasts for around 75mins. the battery can not be replaced. So it has a life of 24months max. So if you are willing to pay 13k(i had paid 15k) for a headphone that lasts 2 years, its a GREAT BUY. Seamless connectivity across the Apple ecosystem, and great Bluetooth connectivity. When it was new it gave around 4hrs of backup in one charge."

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Close to perfect !","I have been a daily user of AirPods pas 2 and a half year . I am not an audiophile but I have an issue with all headphone and earphones use if it’s more than an hour . AirPods have such good design that I never felt an issue . Sound quality is close to awesome , I mean it is best that one could expect from a open set of earphones . This can be used as a daily driver .  The only issue I observed with AirPods is its battery life post 1.5 years of usage . I have to get a new piece after 18 months as after a single charge they could work at best to 30 minutes which is not at all acceptable .  After spending huge amount one would expect atleast 1 hour of use post one full charge ( only earbuds , not case ). At present Apple doesn’t has a battery or earbud replacement program . The cost of replacing two earbuds is same as buying a new one . Over all it’s a good buy if you are planning to use it for 1-2 year . If you are someone who expects a long life from electronics -2-3 years . This isn’t a right choice ."

Since its so compact, its battery is compact as well. So it started after around 1 year, 8 months after purchase the BATTERY started getting drained badly.  And now exactly after 2 years, it lasts for around 75mins. the battery can not be replaced. So it has a life of 24months max. So if you are willing to pay 13k(i had paid 15k) for a headphone that lasts 2 years, its a GREAT BUY. Seamless connectivity across the Apple ecosystem, and great Bluetooth connectivity. When it was new it gave around 4hrs of backup in one charge."

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Close to perfect !","I have been a daily user of AirPods pas 2 and a half year . I am not an audiophile but I have an issue with all headphone and earphones use if it’s more than an hour . AirPods have such good design that I never felt an issue . Sound quality is close to awesome , I mean it is best that one could expect from a open set of earphones . This can be used as a daily driver .  The only issue I observed with AirPods is its battery life post 1.5 years of usage . I have to get a new piece after 18 months as after a single charge they could work at best to 30 minutes which is not at all acceptable .  After spending huge amount one would expect atleast 1 hour of use post one full charge ( only earbuds , not case ). At present Apple doesn’t has a battery or earbud replacement program . The cost of replacing two earbuds is same as buying a new one . Over all it’s a good buy if you are planning to use it for 1-2 year . If you are someone who expects a long life from electronics -2-3 years . This isn’t a right choice ."

Great voice quality and highly convenient for long calls. You can do all your chores while talking with friends/family.  Cons:  1. Zero Noise cancellation 2. The case gets in 2-3 days of normal use 3. Not good for workout (running, gymming, training, etc) 4. Obviously, overpriced."

Extremely light weight. 3. Charging case can charge them for 4 times. 4. Fits most of the ears, please go to nearest apple store, try them for 20-25 mins, if you feel comfortable then only buy. 5. Great voice quality and highly convenient for long calls. You can do all your chores while talking with friends/family.  Cons:  1. Zero Noise cancellation 2. The case gets in 2-3 days of normal use 3. Not good for workout (running, gymming, training, etc) 4. Obviously, overpriced."

One can easily get this quality of sound in earphones which are under Rs 1000 price range. Those who have used Bose Soundsport cannot tolerate this kind of sound quality. 2. There is no cushion or soft pads so after using for sometime it hurts. Not very comfortable for those who use airpods for a long time.  This kind of items cannot be priced above Rs 1000-1500.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Good earphones but not stellar","The particular piece received has a slightly loose hinge on the case. I have used the previous generation Airpods for 2 years and there was no issue. I guess the quality levels have fallen. Apple India has refused to accept this as a warranty issue. Sound quality is good and same as Airpods from 1st gen. There is no noise cancelling feature for that you will need to look at the Airpods pro and shell out extra dough It pairs much faster with devices as compared to last generation Airpods and “hey Siri” feature is great. Expect a lifetime of slightly over 2 years as the battery starts to wear out and there is no way to replace the battery in the buds Overall a good earphones but with some flaws"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Not a good product","After 2 months of buying this, one of the airpods stopped working. Unfortunately this was a gift that wasn't opened until March 2020 after which due to lockdown we were unable to get it sorted. I do not expect this from an apple product."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Two Years LIFE for 15k?","Its a LONG TERM review!! So read till the END. It will LAST FOR TWO YEARS. It was bought by me in Aug 2018. Yes, 2 years back. It was my third apple product, after iPhone 7, and watch series 3. About the product: 1.Design: 3.5/5. >>2. Build 4/5. >>3.Audio Quality: 3.5/5. >>4.Bluetooth Connectivity: 4.5/5 5.Battery: 4/5 >>6.Noise Cancellation: 3/5 >>7.Longevity:2/5  All good. But the BIGGEST ISSUE. Since its so compact, its battery is compact as well. So it started after around 1 year, 8 months after purchase the BATTERY started getting drained badly.  And now exactly after 2 years, it lasts for around 75mins. the battery can not be replaced. So it has a life of 24months max. So if you are willing to pay 13k(i had paid 15k) for a headphone that lasts 2 years, its a GREAT BUY. Seamless connectivity across the Apple ecosystem, and great Bluetooth connectivity. When it was new it gave around 4hrs of backup in one charge."

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Close to perfect !","I have been a daily user of AirPods pas 2 and a half year . I am not an audiophile but I have an issue with all headphone and earphones use if it’s more than an hour . AirPods have such good design that I never felt an issue . Sound quality is close to awesome , I mean it is best that one could expect from a open set of earphones . This can be used as a daily driver .  The only issue I observed with AirPods is its battery life post 1.5 years of usage . I have to get a new piece after 18 months as after a single charge they could work at best to 30 minutes which is not at all acceptable .  After spending huge amount one would expect atleast 1 hour of use post one full charge ( only earbuds , not case ). At present Apple doesn’t has a battery or earbud replacement program . The cost of replacing two earbuds is same as buying a new one . Over all it’s a good buy if you are planning to use it for 1-2 year . If you are someone who expects a long life from electronics -2-3 years . This isn’t a right choice ."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Okay okay 👌","Sounds quality good, battery life also good, value of money but after some time 🕒 lil bit battery life low but it's okay iPhone ho aur airpods na ho esa ho hi nhi sakta"
