Most of the time you have to connect manually by going to settings and blutooth options. Auto connect does not work many times. Especially if you have connected this to multiple devices then you always need to connect manually. 2. There is no noise cancellation which is generally known but what is not so obvious is the loudness of the sound. If you are on road with moderate traffic then you cannot use airpods as the sound output will be too low even at the max level. The same thing is better in iPhones but in Android it is useless. 3. Last and most pathetic - after some days if usage I am unable to talk on phone or whats app using airpods. The other person gets lot of disturbances and get very low voice. This happens in a silent room also.  If you search on web you will find many people facing the same problem. My bad that I did not read those issues earlier.

In case if apple gives us a Service denial letter then only they will return/replace, which I don't think apple will give. Amazon customer care told me to contact Apple support.  I called the Apple support, but they also couldn't help me pair the airpods. They asked to visit the service center.  I visited the service center on same day.

Most of the time you have to connect manually by going to settings and blutooth options. Auto connect does not work many times. Especially if you have connected this to multiple devices then you always need to connect manually. 2. There is no noise cancellation which is generally known but what is not so obvious is the loudness of the sound. If you are on road with moderate traffic then you cannot use airpods as the sound output will be too low even at the max level. The same thing is better in iPhones but in Android it is useless. 3. Last and most pathetic - after some days if usage I am unable to talk on phone or whats app using airpods. The other person gets lot of disturbances and get very low voice. This happens in a silent room also.  If you search on web you will find many people facing the same problem. My bad that I did not read those issues earlier. Just a note that I also tried all workarounds i.e. using single ear phone or absolute noise setting in Android etc. But nothing works.

After so much time calls and transfering calls in between a person called Nirletta attended my call mentioning him as a representative from leadership team who can't tell his last name because of the policy. While talking with him I was bit surprised that was it me or him the customer who came up with complaint. His talk was so arrogant and not at all helpfull. Also he wad very rude and told Amazon will not be responsible for any apple products sell through their online shop.  I don't understand what is the point Amazon mentioning \"Fullfilled by Amazon\" in their products if they can't take the responsibility and customer satisfaction on the products.

I was impressed with sound quality. It was far better than any other true wireless earphone in market. But this is not a good product with Android phone. Reasons below, 1. Most of the time you have to connect manually by going to settings and blutooth options. Auto connect does not work many times. Especially if you have connected this to multiple devices then you always need to connect manually. 2. There is no noise cancellation which is generally known but what is not so obvious is the loudness of the sound. If you are on road with moderate traffic then you cannot use airpods as the sound output will be too low even at the max level. The same thing is better in iPhones but in Android it is useless. 3. Last and most pathetic - after some days if usage I am unable to talk on phone or whats app using airpods. The other person gets lot of disturbances and get very low voice. This happens in a silent room also.  If you search on web you will find many people facing the same problem. My bad that I did not read those issues earlier. Just a note that I also tried all workarounds i.e. using single ear phone or absolute noise setting in Android etc. But nothing works.

(24th Sept) Service center on the diagnosing them, found that the left earpiece is faulty and they will take a week to repair them. I again contacted Amazon customer care and told them apple service center informed me there is a problem with my device, but Amazon customer care wanted a Service Denial letter, which apple refused to give.  As I was stuck with this faulty device now, I had to give the airpods to apple service center for repairs. Today is 6th Oct and I haven't received my airpods from apple service center.

Most of the time you have to connect manually by going to settings and blutooth options. Auto connect does not work many times. Especially if you have connected this to multiple devices then you always need to connect manually. 2. There is no noise cancellation which is generally known but what is not so obvious is the loudness of the sound. If you are on road with moderate traffic then you cannot use airpods as the sound output will be too low even at the max level. The same thing is better in iPhones but in Android it is useless. 3. Last and most pathetic - after some days if usage I am unable to talk on phone or whats app using airpods. The other person gets lot of disturbances and get very low voice. This happens in a silent room also.  If you search on web you will find many people facing the same problem. My bad that I did not read those issues earlier. Just a note that I also tried all workarounds i.e. using single ear phone or absolute noise setting in Android etc. But nothing works.

Especially if you have connected this to multiple devices then you always need to connect manually. 2. There is no noise cancellation which is generally known but what is not so obvious is the loudness of the sound. If you are on road with moderate traffic then you cannot use airpods as the sound output will be too low even at the max level. The same thing is better in iPhones but in Android it is useless. 3. Last and most pathetic - after some days if usage I am unable to talk on phone or whats app using airpods. The other person gets lot of disturbances and get very low voice. This happens in a silent room also.  If you search on web you will find many people facing the same problem. My bad that I did not read those issues earlier.

The first reply I got from the executive was I have to open a case with Apple for any issues related with apple products either from a nearest store or via help desk. After so much time calls and transfering calls in between a person called Nirletta attended my call mentioning him as a representative from leadership team who can't tell his last name because of the policy. While talking with him I was bit surprised that was it me or him the customer who came up with complaint. His talk was so arrogant and not at all helpfull. Also he wad very rude and told Amazon will not be responsible for any apple products sell through their online shop.  I don't understand what is the point Amazon mentioning \"Fullfilled by Amazon\" in their products if they can't take the responsibility and customer satisfaction on the products.

I was impressed with sound quality. It was far better than any other true wireless earphone in market. But this is not a good product with Android phone. Reasons below, 1. Most of the time you have to connect manually by going to settings and blutooth options. Auto connect does not work many times. Especially if you have connected this to multiple devices then you always need to connect manually. 2. There is no noise cancellation which is generally known but what is not so obvious is the loudness of the sound. If you are on road with moderate traffic then you cannot use airpods as the sound output will be too low even at the max level. The same thing is better in iPhones but in Android it is useless. 3. Last and most pathetic - after some days if usage I am unable to talk on phone or whats app using airpods. The other person gets lot of disturbances and get very low voice. This happens in a silent room also.  If you search on web you will find many people facing the same problem. My bad that I did not read those issues earlier. Just a note that I also tried all workarounds i.e. using single ear phone or absolute noise setting in Android etc. But nothing works.

Be careful when you order airpods from Amazon. If you receive a defective product, Amazon policy says to get it repaired or replaced through Apple service center. Only if Apple say they are not able to repair then Amazon will replace/return it, which they won't give in writing.  In my case , I ordered the airpods on 22nd Sept and got them delivered on 24th. When I tried to pair, I was unable to pair it with my phones ( Tried 4 different phone, iphones and android). The airpods case was flashing green light. Did some internet research and found that flashing green means one of the earpiece is defective.  I called the Amazon customer care, but they refused to return/replace the item because as per them apple service centers are only authorized to repair/replace the item. In case if apple gives us a Service denial letter then only they will return/replace, which I don't think apple will give. Amazon customer care told me to contact Apple support.  I called the Apple support, but they also couldn't help me pair the airpods. They asked to visit the service center.  I visited the service center on same day. (24th Sept) Service center on the diagnosing them, found that the left earpiece is faulty and they will take a week to repair them. I again contacted Amazon customer care and told them apple service center informed me there is a problem with my device, but Amazon customer care wanted a Service Denial letter, which apple refused to give.  As I was stuck with this faulty device now, I had to give the airpods to apple service center for repairs. Today is 6th Oct and I haven't received my airpods from apple service center.  I won't recommend buying these product if the Apple service center is not in same town as where you order them.
