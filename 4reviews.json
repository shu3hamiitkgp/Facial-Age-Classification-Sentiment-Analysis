I have some reasons of my own, which may/may not fit your case. Read on to decide.  1. Seamless connectivity with \uf8ff devices: the most important reason for me. Once I connected it to my phone, it automatically connects with my ipad signed in to the same \uf8ff ID. No pairing/unpairing/repairing required. This adds a great value to the user experience. Just take out your TWS from the case and they are good to go!  2. Connection with multiple devices simultaneously: The airpods connect both to my ipad and phone. I can pick up my calls on my phone, switch to airpods and continue with my call. In case of another device, I would first need to unpair, repair and continue my call. This is another big bonus for me and simplifies things!  3. Good connectivity range and battery life: Battery life is decent. Will last you through long sessions of calls and online meetings. You can use mono or both airpods as per your choice.  What should you keep in mind before purchasing:  1. Price: These are some of the costliest devices in this category in the market. So you need to be doubly sure that they justify their value to you before you buy them.  2. Sound quality: Don't expect earth shattering bass from these. They are good to go daily use earphones. Powerful bass gives me a bad headache. Hence this was a bonus for me. However, the sound quality will be deal breaker for many. Do try them and listen to your playlist before you decide.  3. Strange shape: They fit perfectly into some ears while being a pain for others. Again, my advice is to try them in your ears before you purchase. If they feel uncomfortable after 5 minutes, you will regret buying them. You can purchase additional rubber pads/hooks for a good fit, but again that will set you back by 300-500 bucks. Hence, caution is advised!  Sincere advice: If you are buying them just to show your status quo of owning an \uf8ff device ( many people do this, including myself - its absolutely normal with \uf8ff), there are cheap lookalikes available for 200-500 bucks. Buy them, flaunt them and use the remaining sum in some other place!  For those looking to buy these for sound quality, do give these a try before purchasing. It may save you a lot of heartache later!  If you have reasons similar to mine, these airpods are excellent value for money, thanks to their good handshake with the \uf8ff ecosystem. Wireless charging variant is a gimmick in my opinion - again see if you can justify shelling out those extra bucks for the ease of wireless charging these maybe once a week!  Hope the review helps!

The airpods are on the pricier side, thanks to the \uf8ff branding. In today's era when wireless earbuds are available for as low as 2k, why settle for these?? I have some reasons of my own, which may/may not fit your case. Read on to decide.  1. Seamless connectivity with \uf8ff devices: the most important reason for me. Once I connected it to my phone, it automatically connects with my ipad signed in to the same \uf8ff ID. No pairing/unpairing/repairing required. This adds a great value to the user experience. Just take out your TWS from the case and they are good to go!  2. Connection with multiple devices simultaneously: The airpods connect both to my ipad and phone. I can pick up my calls on my phone, switch to airpods and continue with my call. In case of another device, I would first need to unpair, repair and continue my call. This is another big bonus for me and simplifies things!  3. Good connectivity range and battery life: Battery life is decent. Will last you through long sessions of calls and online meetings. You can use mono or both airpods as per your choice.  What should you keep in mind before purchasing:  1. Price: These are some of the costliest devices in this category in the market. So you need to be doubly sure that they justify their value to you before you buy them.  2. Sound quality: Don't expect earth shattering bass from these. They are good to go daily use earphones. Powerful bass gives me a bad headache. Hence this was a bonus for me. However, the sound quality will be deal breaker for many. Do try them and listen to your playlist before you decide.  3. Strange shape: They fit perfectly into some ears while being a pain for others. Again, my advice is to try them in your ears before you purchase. If they feel uncomfortable after 5 minutes, you will regret buying them. You can purchase additional rubber pads/hooks for a good fit, but again that will set you back by 300-500 bucks. Hence, caution is advised!  Sincere advice: If you are buying them just to show your status quo of owning an \uf8ff device ( many people do this, including myself - its absolutely normal with \uf8ff), there are cheap lookalikes available for 200-500 bucks. Buy them, flaunt them and use the remaining sum in some other place!  For those looking to buy these for sound quality, do give these a try before purchasing. It may save you a lot of heartache later!  If you have reasons similar to mine, these airpods are excellent value for money, thanks to their good handshake with the \uf8ff ecosystem. Wireless charging variant is a gimmick in my opinion - again see if you can justify shelling out those extra bucks for the ease of wireless charging these maybe once a week!  Hope the review helps!

The airpods are on the pricier side, thanks to the \uf8ff branding. In today's era when wireless earbuds are available for as low as 2k, why settle for these?? I have some reasons of my own, which may/may not fit your case. Read on to decide.  1. Seamless connectivity with \uf8ff devices: the most important reason for me. Once I connected it to my phone, it automatically connects with my ipad signed in to the same \uf8ff ID. No pairing/unpairing/repairing required. This adds a great value to the user experience. Just take out your TWS from the case and they are good to go!  2. Connection with multiple devices simultaneously: The airpods connect both to my ipad and phone. I can pick up my calls on my phone, switch to airpods and continue with my call. In case of another device, I would first need to unpair, repair and continue my call. This is another big bonus for me and simplifies things!  3. Good connectivity range and battery life: Battery life is decent. Will last you through long sessions of calls and online meetings. You can use mono or both airpods as per your choice.  What should you keep in mind before purchasing:  1. Price: These are some of the costliest devices in this category in the market. So you need to be doubly sure that they justify their value to you before you buy them.  2. Sound quality: Don't expect earth shattering bass from these. They are good to go daily use earphones. Powerful bass gives me a bad headache. Hence this was a bonus for me. However, the sound quality will be deal breaker for many. Do try them and listen to your playlist before you decide.  3. Strange shape: They fit perfectly into some ears while being a pain for others. Again, my advice is to try them in your ears before you purchase. If they feel uncomfortable after 5 minutes, you will regret buying them. You can purchase additional rubber pads/hooks for a good fit, but again that will set you back by 300-500 bucks. Hence, caution is advised!  Sincere advice: If you are buying them just to show your status quo of owning an \uf8ff device ( many people do this, including myself - its absolutely normal with \uf8ff), there are cheap lookalikes available for 200-500 bucks. Buy them, flaunt them and use the remaining sum in some other place!  For those looking to buy these for sound quality, do give these a try before purchasing. It may save you a lot of heartache later!  If you have reasons similar to mine, these airpods are excellent value for money, thanks to their good handshake with the \uf8ff ecosystem. Wireless charging variant is a gimmick in my opinion - again see if you can justify shelling out those extra bucks for the ease of wireless charging these maybe once a week!  Hope the review helps!

If you buy one, you'll hold one of the most complicated designed but a very well built piece of tech at this price.  My first glance at the Airpods was pretty delusional. Still being in the Apple ecosystem I wanted to try it. You will never experience the same pairing method in any other wireless earbud. Thanks to the H1 chip inside it. Pop the case open, hold it near your device and magic begins. The older versions of iPhone may have a tough time connecting to it because the W1 chip was introduced from iPhone 7 onwards. If you have one and find yourself struggling connecting to your device, it's normal.  I personally find the Airpods a great fit and they do not fall from your ears even when you're running or sweating in the gym. The audio is well balanced and are comparable to the Apple Earpods. Sometimes even better. If you're an audiophile and a bass person, go for a better option like the Powerbeats pro. Another pro is the ergonomics and design of Airpods. They fit inside your denim's coin pocket perfectly. Yes they're that small.  Touch controls are sometimes hard to get right. You don't tap on the Airpods but to hit hard on it with your finger couple times to get it working. The touch controls can be customised by getting into the bluetooth menu. \"Hey siri\" is always on listening mode so you can make calls, get directions, send texts, set reminders, change volume levels and much more.  So is it really for you? Well, it depends. If you're into Apple Ecosystem, have some decent amount of money to spare and you're looking for wireless earbuds to listen to music and attend calls, go for it. They are also great for people who travel thanks to its compact size. If you're into audio monitoring, sound design, video editing or some similar professional work, this might not be the ideal option.  To conclude, Airpods are an amazing piece of technology ever built by Apple. They won't let you down if you're into listening to music, attending calls and give instructions to siri. If you have one already and are disappointed, they are not meant for you. Look for a better option."}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "It's from Apple that's it.", "body": "Great product from Apple, buy if you have iPhone because it can do so many things with iPhone even sometimes it can be use as a remote to control TV"}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Genuine item received guys call to apple call centre to extend warranty i did that", "body": "Received today and it\u2019s genuine item satisfaction for warranty related issues call to apple india customer centre"}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "It\u2019s ok but after an year facing microphone issues", "body": "After using the AirPods 2 for more than a year, it was a good overall experience.

I like the glossy look but it may not last long.  A heavily priced product, but I think that's what apple does in pricing any of it's products.  As of now I'm loving the AirPods and I have to wait and see how they make me feel in the long run.  Coming to battery life there's a drastic battery drain on iphone as the bluetooth has to be turned on always. Earpods consume the minimum amount of battery power. A 1% to 2% battery usage(on iphone), while listening to music using earpods for an hour is equal to 10%(approximately) battery usage with AirPods for the same time.  The best thing is you can get rid of wire. That's what I've mainly purchased for. AirPods do not fall from ear so easily even while running.  After Using them for a couple of days:  There are equal number of flaws as well. AirPods discharge when they are kept outside even when you don't use them. It means you have to keep it in the case all the time you are not using them and that's what Apple also wants us to do. I wonder what happens to the battery life because we are overcharging them several times a day. And the charge cycles are gonna be very irregular. In my case, AirPods battery status never came below 60% because I have to keep them back in the case when I don't use them. After all they are batteries and they age. I wish Apple bothered to give some assurance to their customers.  Another one is, the lid, when opened tilts if you try. They could've improved the quality.

The airpods are on the pricier side, thanks to the \uf8ff branding. In today's era when wireless earbuds are available for as low as 2k, why settle for these?? I have some reasons of my own, which may/may not fit your case. Read on to decide.  1. Seamless connectivity with \uf8ff devices: the most important reason for me. Once I connected it to my phone, it automatically connects with my ipad signed in to the same \uf8ff ID. No pairing/unpairing/repairing required. This adds a great value to the user experience. Just take out your TWS from the case and they are good to go!  2. Connection with multiple devices simultaneously: The airpods connect both to my ipad and phone. I can pick up my calls on my phone, switch to airpods and continue with my call. In case of another device, I would first need to unpair, repair and continue my call. This is another big bonus for me and simplifies things!  3. Good connectivity range and battery life: Battery life is decent. Will last you through long sessions of calls and online meetings. You can use mono or both airpods as per your choice.  What should you keep in mind before purchasing:  1. Price: These are some of the costliest devices in this category in the market. So you need to be doubly sure that they justify their value to you before you buy them.  2. Sound quality: Don't expect earth shattering bass from these. They are good to go daily use earphones. Powerful bass gives me a bad headache. Hence this was a bonus for me. However, the sound quality will be deal breaker for many. Do try them and listen to your playlist before you decide.  3. Strange shape: They fit perfectly into some ears while being a pain for others. Again, my advice is to try them in your ears before you purchase. If they feel uncomfortable after 5 minutes, you will regret buying them. You can purchase additional rubber pads/hooks for a good fit, but again that will set you back by 300-500 bucks. Hence, caution is advised!  Sincere advice: If you are buying them just to show your status quo of owning an \uf8ff device ( many people do this, including myself - its absolutely normal with \uf8ff), there are cheap lookalikes available for 200-500 bucks. Buy them, flaunt them and use the remaining sum in some other place!  For those looking to buy these for sound quality, do give these a try before purchasing. It may save you a lot of heartache later!  If you have reasons similar to mine, these airpods are excellent value for money, thanks to their good handshake with the \uf8ff ecosystem. Wireless charging variant is a gimmick in my opinion - again see if you can justify shelling out those extra bucks for the ease of wireless charging these maybe once a week!  Hope the review helps!

If you buy one, you'll hold one of the most complicated designed but a very well built piece of tech at this price.  My first glance at the Airpods was pretty delusional. Still being in the Apple ecosystem I wanted to try it. You will never experience the same pairing method in any other wireless earbud. Thanks to the H1 chip inside it. Pop the case open, hold it near your device and magic begins. The older versions of iPhone may have a tough time connecting to it because the W1 chip was introduced from iPhone 7 onwards. If you have one and find yourself struggling connecting to your device, it's normal.  I personally find the Airpods a great fit and they do not fall from your ears even when you're running or sweating in the gym. The audio is well balanced and are comparable to the Apple Earpods. Sometimes even better. If you're an audiophile and a bass person, go for a better option like the Powerbeats pro. Another pro is the ergonomics and design of Airpods. They fit inside your denim's coin pocket perfectly. Yes they're that small.  Touch controls are sometimes hard to get right. You don't tap on the Airpods but to hit hard on it with your finger couple times to get it working. The touch controls can be customised by getting into the bluetooth menu. \"Hey siri\" is always on listening mode so you can make calls, get directions, send texts, set reminders, change volume levels and much more.  So is it really for you? Well, it depends. If you're into Apple Ecosystem, have some decent amount of money to spare and you're looking for wireless earbuds to listen to music and attend calls, go for it. They are also great for people who travel thanks to its compact size. If you're into audio monitoring, sound design, video editing or some similar professional work, this might not be the ideal option.  To conclude, Airpods are an amazing piece of technology ever built by Apple. They won't let you down if you're into listening to music, attending calls and give instructions to siri. If you have one already and are disappointed, they are not meant for you.

I have some reasons of my own, which may/may not fit your case. Read on to decide.  1. Seamless connectivity with \uf8ff devices: the most important reason for me. Once I connected it to my phone, it automatically connects with my ipad signed in to the same \uf8ff ID. No pairing/unpairing/repairing required. This adds a great value to the user experience. Just take out your TWS from the case and they are good to go!  2. Connection with multiple devices simultaneously: The airpods connect both to my ipad and phone. I can pick up my calls on my phone, switch to airpods and continue with my call. In case of another device, I would first need to unpair, repair and continue my call. This is another big bonus for me and simplifies things!  3. Good connectivity range and battery life: Battery life is decent. Will last you through long sessions of calls and online meetings. You can use mono or both airpods as per your choice.  What should you keep in mind before purchasing:  1. Price: These are some of the costliest devices in this category in the market. So you need to be doubly sure that they justify their value to you before you buy them.  2. Sound quality: Don't expect earth shattering bass from these. They are good to go daily use earphones. Powerful bass gives me a bad headache. Hence this was a bonus for me. However, the sound quality will be deal breaker for many. Do try them and listen to your playlist before you decide.  3. Strange shape: They fit perfectly into some ears while being a pain for others. Again, my advice is to try them in your ears before you purchase. If they feel uncomfortable after 5 minutes, you will regret buying them. You can purchase additional rubber pads/hooks for a good fit, but again that will set you back by 300-500 bucks. Hence, caution is advised!  Sincere advice: If you are buying them just to show your status quo of owning an \uf8ff device ( many people do this, including myself - its absolutely normal with \uf8ff), there are cheap lookalikes available for 200-500 bucks. Buy them, flaunt them and use the remaining sum in some other place!  For those looking to buy these for sound quality, do give these a try before purchasing. It may save you a lot of heartache later!  If you have reasons similar to mine, these airpods are excellent value for money, thanks to their good handshake with the \uf8ff ecosystem. Wireless charging variant is a gimmick in my opinion - again see if you can justify shelling out those extra bucks for the ease of wireless charging these maybe once a week!  Hope the review helps!
